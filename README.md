# VSCode Dark Theme for IDA Pro 7.x  

![VSCode Screenshot](https://github.com/alexander-pick/ida-vscode-theme/raw/master/vscode_theme_screen.png)

This is a vscode like theme for IDA 7.x with native theme support. It is somehow based on the orginal visual studio code theme/idea by zyantific but a lot has been rewritten during the porting process. It is not a 1:1 port as I adjust a bunch of things to server my taste/needs. Feedback is always welcome! 

Tested with IDA 7.5, to install just copy the vscode theme folder to:

IDADIR/themes/

Works very well on IDA for Linux and Window, not tested on OSX yet.

This theme is also released under the MIT License.
