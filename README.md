# VSCode Dark Theme for IDA Pro 7.x  
This is a vscode like theme for IDA 7.x with native theme support, it is somehow based on the orginal visual studio code theme/idea by zyantific but a lot has been rewritten. Tested with IDA 7.5, to install just copy the vscode theme folder to:

IDADIR/themes/

Works very well on IDA for Linux and Window, not tested on OSX yet.

This theme is also released under the MIT License.
